# OpenSearch UpgradeOptim

### Migrating, upgrading, and sometimes just comparing the performance of two clusters


### What is this?

OpenSearch UpgradeOptim is used to facilitate migrations to OpenSearch, upgrades to newer versions of OpenSearch, and optimizing a cluster based on traffic patterns. This package can help you can set up a proof-of-concept environment locally using Docker containers or deploy to AWS using a one-click deployment script. This empowers you to fine-tune cluster configurations and manage workloads more effectively before migration.
